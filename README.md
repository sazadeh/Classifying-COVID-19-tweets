Classifying COVID-19 related Tweets based on Gender and Sentiment

**Objective**
The objective of this research is to do sentiment analysis and gender prediction based on the tweet text and then try to classify the tweets based on their 
sentiments and gender with different machine learning models and compare the results. 

**Background**
News and awareness about COVID-19 spread like the pandemic itself on social media.  During the resulting lockdown, people used social media to express their
feelings and find and share Covid-19 related information. Estimating the “Sentiment” associated with a message is one aspect of how Twitter data is analyzed.
Different tools have been used for sentiment analysis in the literature. It can be performed by a lexicon-based approach such as LIWC, machine learning approaches
such as SVM, NB, RF, or MLP, or a hybrid approach. For Gender prediction there are some researches base on the tweets or images or mixed of them with RNN. 
The information extracted from sentiment analysis and gender prediction can be used in different fields such as marketing, legal investigation, and personalization.
